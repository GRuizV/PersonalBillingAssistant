Alright, bud, time to continue with something different. 

let's discuss a bit how Amazon Textract works, ok?

Do you know what are the available tools or capabilities of it?


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let‚Äôs shift gears and break down Amazon Textract.

üß† Assumption Check
You‚Äôre likely assuming Textract is a general-purpose OCR tool, but it‚Äôs much more targeted: it‚Äôs a structured data extraction service that goes beyond just detecting text ‚Äî it tries to understand the layout and semantics of documents.

Let‚Äôs break down its core capabilities.

üì¶ Core Tools & Capabilities in Amazon Textract
Capability	Description
1. Detect Document Text	Performs standard OCR. Returns lines and words from images or scanned PDFs. No understanding of layout or form structure.
2. Analyze Document	Recognizes key-value pairs (e.g. in forms), and table structures. Useful for extracting structured data like names, dates, and invoice numbers.
3. Analyze Expense	Purpose-built for receipts and invoices. Returns line items, total amounts, vendors, etc.
4. Analyze ID	Tailored for identity documents (e.g. passports, driver‚Äôs licenses). Extracts key fields like name, DOB, and document number.
5. Start Document Text Detection (Async)	Async version for processing large documents in S3 (PDFs or TIFFs).
6. Start Document Analysis (Async)	Async version of AnalyzeDocument, also S3-based, used when working with multipage docs.
7. Queries (Newer feature)	You can ask Textract to extract information via natural language questions. E.g., "What is the total amount?", "Who is the recipient?" ‚Äî available in AnalyzeDocument.
8. Bounding Boxes and Confidence Scores	All elements (words, fields, tables) come with bounding boxes and confidence scores for layout-aware postprocessing.
9. Human-in-the-loop (A2I)	Textract can integrate with Amazon Augmented AI (A2I) for human review of low-confidence results.
10. Output in JSON	Every response is structured, returning JSON with positions, types, confidence, and relationships between detected elements.

üß† Advanced Use Case Paths
Form Extraction ‚Üí Use AnalyzeDocument with "FORMS" feature type

Tables ‚Üí Use AnalyzeDocument with "TABLES" feature type

Invoices/Receipts ‚Üí Use AnalyzeExpense

Multi-page PDFs ‚Üí Use Async variants (e.g., StartDocumentAnalysis) with an S3 input and Amazon SNS for callbacks

üß≠ Alternative Views
Textract is not a general-purpose document classifier or question-answering system. It's more like a semantic OCR engine tuned for enterprise documents.

It can be used with LangChain or similar pipelines to interpret documents as part of LLM flows ‚Äî for example, extracting content and then reasoning on top of it.

For fine-grained control or customized parsing (like custom invoice layouts), many still pair Textract with custom post-processing logic.

Would you like to:

Dive deeper into one of the APIs?

Explore a usage architecture (e.g. S3 + Lambda + Textract + A2I)?

Or analyze whether Textract is the right tool for a specific use case?

Let‚Äôs test the next branch.






You said:
Alright, appreciate, now. Let's discuss a bit more. 

I made a couple of tests to see how different were the responses when different tool were used (like "AnalyzeDocument - Tables"; "AnalyzeDocument - Forms"; "	
AnalyzeExpense"; and "DetectDocumentText - OCR"). 

And the use case was to see how Amazon Textract deliver in each case for a 4-pages Card Bill. 

Now, let me show my asumption of how it works: It will always generate a JSON file (quite large) with each detected element, coordinates, relationships, identifier and a bunch of other data regarding the detection; and multiple .csv depending on what was requested. Is it always the same case? Is it a way to modify how the JSON is generated?

Because from my perspective, to directly connect the result to an app, the JSON isn't the best choice, since it show all the elements but as individuals. If you ask me, I found more useful perhaps processing the .csv since the expenses were already arranged, but up to this point, I am standing on how I think the tool works, now's your turn.


ChatGPT said:
Great. You're putting Textract to a proper real-world stress test, and your framing is on point. Let‚Äôs deconstruct this with the usual lens.

üß† 1. Assumption Check
Your main assumptions seem to be:

Textract always returns JSON (large, low-level, verbose)

CSV outputs are available for certain tools and often more usable

The JSON structure isn't modifiable and may be unsuitable for direct app integration

Detected elements in the JSON are mostly ‚Äúflat‚Äù (individual, non-semantic) and require external logic to group/aggregate

Different tools (e.g., AnalyzeExpense vs DetectDocumentText) return materially different levels of structure

These are all mostly grounded ‚Äî but there are some edge cases and levers worth examining.

üß† 2. Counter-Arguments & Clarifications
üî∏ JSON Structure Is Verbose but Semantic, Not Flat
While the JSON seems flat, it contains explicit relationships (e.g., "Relationships": [{ "Type": "CHILD", "Ids": [...] }]) that form semantic graphs of key-value pairs, tables, and blocks.

But: you‚Äôre right that these must be parsed client-side to reconstruct meaning ‚Äî AWS doesn‚Äôt ship them in ready-to-consume structures like tables or records out-of-the-box.

üî∏ You Can‚Äôt Directly Modify the JSON Output Format
Textract‚Äôs JSON output schema is fixed per API version. No setting changes the format.

What you can do is:

Preprocess the image/document (e.g. rotate, crop, enhance layout clarity)

Use Queries to ask only for relevant fields (in AnalyzeDocument)

Postprocess with libraries like amazon-textract-response-parser (AWS-maintained)

üî∏ CSVs Are Not Native to Textract
Textract does not generate CSVs by default.

CSVs are usually created by postprocessors, like:

Textract Parser (AWS examples)

Textract PrettyPrinter

Custom Lambda pipelines

So if you're getting CSVs, you're likely using a wrapper, CLI tool, or Lambda function that extracts tables or key-value pairs and converts them.

üß† 3. Alternative Framing
View	Explanation
Textract = Document Graph Generator	It emits a graph of blocks (words, lines, tables, keys) with bounding boxes and relationships ‚Äî like an abstract syntax tree for documents.
CSV is a post-product, not a native output	The structured tables you get in CSV are not generated by Textract, but inferred from the JSON through downstream logic.
Textract is meant to be composed	It‚Äôs designed as an intermediate step, assuming you‚Äôll build logic to group data, store structured records, or enrich with LLMs or business rules.
Different tools = different schemas	AnalyzeExpense and AnalyzeID return high-level schemas (like SummaryFields, LineItemGroups) ‚Äî much easier to use than the raw block format of AnalyzeDocument.
Queries are underused	With AnalyzeDocument, you can now specify questions like ‚ÄúWhat is the cardholder name?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the due date?‚Äù, and Textract will focus extraction accordingly.

üß™ Logic Audit
Your frustration with the raw JSON output being too low-level for direct integration is 100% valid.

However:

It‚Äôs by design ‚Äî AWS wants to give you flexibility, not opinions.

The relationship graph in the JSON is powerful, but only if you build logic to walk it.

There‚Äôs no flag like "output_mode": "structured" or "flattened": true.

If you're building an app, it's fair to ask: should Textract also offer native structured outputs? Possibly, but right now, it's up to us.

‚úÖ Final Recap
Feature	Textract
JSON Output	Always returned; structure varies by tool (e.g., AnalyzeExpense vs AnalyzeDocument)
Modifiability	Not directly; use downstream logic or preprocessing
CSVs	Not native; must be extracted via parsers or your own logic
Best App Integration Strategy	Parse JSON ‚Üí Transform into app-ready structure (e.g. records, tables, summaries)
Alternative for Simpler Needs	Try AnalyzeExpense or Queries on AnalyzeDocument for higher abstraction

Want to:

Dive into how to parse the block graph efficiently?

Map your use case to the best tool (AnalyzeExpense vs Queries)?

Or build a pipeline that automatically turns Textract output into app-ready records?

You‚Äôve got plenty of paths to choose.






You said:
ALright, let's discuss a bit more. What I want it to extract expenses from a Credit Card Bill, what I ultimately need is to pul out of the PDF three things: the date, the description of the expense and the value, alright?

I've been experimenting with py libraries like PDFPlumber, which has proveen to be quite good. But Amazon Textract came as an alternative, more sustainable and scalable. So my first questions is regarding whether Textract is an overkill or is it justified? and also, what would be best in my case, to use the CSVs provided in the responses? Are this csvs part of an API Response if I decided to integrate this into the app? for my use case, is it better to configure to get the JSON and build the logic to extract or is that a rework given that there are some prepreared option?

What do you think?


ChatGPT said:
Great. You're asking the exact right questions for productizing a doc-parsing workflow ‚Äî especially one that starts as a personal project and may evolve into a production app.

Let‚Äôs break this down as rigorously as we can.

üß† 1. Assumption Check
You're assuming:

Textract may be overkill for a relatively structured, known-format doc (credit card bills)

CSVs might be available directly via API and more convenient than JSON

There's a tradeoff between writing your own logic to parse JSON vs relying on auto-generated formats (CSVs, key-value pairs)

Py libraries like pdfplumber might be good enough ‚Äî and you‚Äôre wondering if Textract‚Äôs scalability justifies the added complexity.

These are all smart lines of thought. Let‚Äôs challenge and expand them.

üß† 2. Counter-Arguments & Reality Check
‚ö†Ô∏è Textract Does Not Return CSVs via API
The CSV files are not part of the API response. They are postprocessed artifacts, often created with:

AWS-provided examples

CLI tools or SageMaker notebooks

Open-source libraries like amazon-textract-response-parser

So if you‚Äôre using Textract via API or SDK, you‚Äôll always get a JSON block graph, and you must build your own CSV logic (or use a parser lib).

üß† Textract May Be Overkill If:
Your input documents are highly regular in format (e.g., same bank, same layout every time)

You can reliably extract rows using PDF tools like pdfplumber or fitz (PyMuPDF)

You don‚Äôt expect variation in structure (different issuers, bill types, image scans, etc.)

BUT‚Äî

‚úÖ Textract May Be Justified If:
You expect the bills to come from multiple sources or contain slightly varying formats

Some of them might be scanned images, password-protected, or exported from different systems

You want to scale this with minimal maintenance, perhaps even integrating human-in-the-loop review down the line

üß† 3. Alternative View: What's Your Real Constraint?
Let‚Äôs split the question:

Question	Best Path
Can I use CSVs directly from Textract API?	‚ùå No. You get JSON. CSV is postprocessing.
Can I build a robust app without Textract?	‚úÖ If your source format is known, pdfplumber + regex/table parsing is great.
Is Textract justified?	‚úÖ If you're planning to scale across formats/sources or get noisy/scanned docs
Should I parse JSON manually?	‚ùå Not from scratch ‚Äî use AWS‚Äôs textract-response-parser or a custom adapter
Best way to extract Date, Description, Value?	Use AnalyzeExpense if the card bill is receipt-like. Or AnalyzeDocument + TABLES. Then use block relationships to reconstruct rows.

üß™ Logic Audit: JSON vs CSV vs App Integration
Let‚Äôs go from raw to app-ready:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
PDF ‚Üí Textract ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí [Block graph] ‚Üí Parsed (rows: date, desc, value) ‚Üí App
                                     ‚Ü≥ Optional: Generate CSV from parsed rows
JSON is required if using the API.

CSVs can be created from the parsed rows, but are not returned directly.

The real job is transforming Textract‚Äôs block graph into rows ‚Äî this can be abstracted once and reused.

üß∞ Recommendation for Your Use Case
Situation	Recommendation
Single format, clean PDFs	Stick with pdfplumber and build a format-specific parser. It's lighter and faster.
Multi-format, image-based or scanned bills	Use Textract‚Äôs AnalyzeDocument with TABLES, or AnalyzeExpense if it fits.
Building an app with API integration	Accept JSON, use AWS‚Äôs parser or your logic to extract rows. Generate your own CSVs if needed.
Want higher abstraction	Try Textract's Queries API to directly ask ‚ÄúWhat are the transactions?‚Äù ‚Äî this can be more targeted than parsing the whole block graph.

üß≠ Final Advice
If you're still prototyping and documents are uniform, don‚Äôt move to Textract yet. Optimize with pdfplumber and build a clean extractor.

Once you're ready to support variable layouts, scanned uploads, or external users, move to Textract, but treat JSON as a graph to walk, not as a flat dump.

Want a visual of how the JSON relationships work for reconstructing table rows? Or should we try a side-by-side comparison of output from pdfplumber vs AnalyzeDocument?
