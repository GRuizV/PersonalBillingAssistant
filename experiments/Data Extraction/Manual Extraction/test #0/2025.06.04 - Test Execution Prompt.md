## Test Objective

**Purpose**: Evaluate if the LLM can accurately:
1. Recognize and interpret a banking bill PDF
2. Extract structured data: date, charge concept/description, and amount
3. Return the data in a format that is:
    - Structured (e.g. JSON, CSV-like table)
    - Machine- and human-readable.
    - Measurable against a known ground truth


## Reusable Prompt Template

“You will be given one credit card bill (in PDF or image format). Your task is to extract valid transactions and return them in a strict, structured format.

    Output Format:
    “
    {
    "bill_name": "MC - FEB-2025",
    "transactions": [
        {
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "description": "Transaction Description",
        "amount": 12345
        }
    ]
    }
    ”

Instructions:
1.	Use the "VALOR COMPRA" column — ignore other values like "CARGOS Y ABONOS".
2.	Only include transactions where the value is greater than 0.
3.	Normalize all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.
4.	Return amounts as whole integers, with no commas, no dollar signs, and no decimal points.
5.	Return only the JSON — do not add any explanations or Markdown formatting.

Example Output:
    
    “
    {
    "bill_name": "VS - MAR-2025",
    "transactions": [
        {
        "date": "2025-03-23",
        "description": "GREEN EDS PASOANCHO CALI",
        "amount": 149610
        },
        {
        "date": "2025-03-22",
        "description": "KV GROUP SAS CALI",
        "amount": 41600
        }
    ]
    }
    ”

  
You may now begin parsing the attached bill. ”
