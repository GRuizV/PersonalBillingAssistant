# PDF Credit Card Expense Extractor - Project Summary Report

## 📅 Project Details
- **Date**: June 16, 2025
- **Time**: 5:52 PM - 6:30 PM (America/Bogota, UTC-5:00)
- **Duration**: ~38 minutes
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully Completed and Tested

## 🤖 AI Configuration
- **Primary Mode**: 🧭 Orchestrator (Guided) - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- **Delegated Mode**: 💻 Code - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- **Cost**: $0.24
- **Token Usage**: 18,565 tokens (9% of context)

## 🎯 Task Objective
Build a standalone Python CLI application that receives credit card bills in PDF format and extracts the list of expenses using text-based PDF parsing.

### Scope Requirements
- ✅ Input: Text-based PDF from one known card issuer
- ✅ Output: CLI table displaying each expense (date, description, amount)
- ✅ Tools: Use `pdfplumber` for parsing
- ❌ No categorization, aggregation, CSV export, or GUI
- 🧪 Success Criteria: Correctly extract and report expense lines

## 🛠 What Was Done

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Created application in `Tests/(Nima) PBA/test #1/` directory
- Established clean project organization with documentation

### 2. Core Application Development
- **Main File**: `pdf_expense_extractor.py` (234 lines)
- **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt` (pdfplumber, tabulate)
- **Documentation**: `README.md` with comprehensive usage instructions

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **PDF Processing**: Used `pdfplumber` for text extraction from all pages
- **Regex Parsing**: Implemented pattern matching for:
  - Date: `\d{2} \d{2} \d{2}` (DD MM YY format)
  - Description: Longest alphanumeric block between date and amount
  - Amount: Currency format with $ and commas (Colombian Pesos)
- **Output**: Clean table display using `tabulate` library
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and logging

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- `PDFExpenseExtractor` class with modular methods
- File validation and existence checking
- Multi-page PDF text extraction
- Regex-based expense line parsing
- Summary statistics (total transactions and amounts)
- Detailed logging and error reporting

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Architecture Decisions
- **Class-based design**: Chose OOP approach for better code organization and reusability
- **Hardcoded PDF path**: Per user request, avoided CLI argument parsing
- **Single responsibility methods**: Each method handles one specific task

### 2. Technical Decisions
- **pdfplumber over PyPDF2**: Better text extraction capabilities for complex layouts
- **tabulate over rich**: Simpler, more focused table output
- **Regex approach**: Direct pattern matching for known expense line format
- **Page-by-page processing**: Handles multi-page PDFs efficiently

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
- File existence validation before processing
- Graceful handling of PDF extraction failures
- Detailed logging for debugging purposes
- Summary reporting even with partial failures

## 📊 Results Achieved
- ✅ **Successful Test**: User confirmed the script works as intended
- ✅ **Clean Output**: Properly formatted table with Date, Description, Amount columns
- ✅ **Robust Parsing**: Successfully extracts data from known expense line format
- ✅ **Error Resilience**: Handles edge cases and provides meaningful feedback
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete setup and usage instructions provided

## ⚠️ Potential Risks & Considerations

### 1. Data Format Dependencies
- **Risk**: Hardcoded regex patterns may fail if card issuer changes PDF format
- **Mitigation**: Patterns are well-documented and easily adjustable

### 2. PDF Complexity
- **Risk**: Complex PDF layouts or image-based PDFs may not extract properly
- **Mitigation**: Current implementation focuses on text-based PDFs as specified

### 3. Currency Assumptions
- **Risk**: Assumes Colombian Peso format with $ symbol and comma separators
- **Mitigation**: Clearly documented in code comments

### 4. Scale Limitations
- **Risk**: Single PDF processing only, no batch processing
- **Mitigation**: Architecture supports easy extension for batch processing

## 🚀 Recommended Enhancements & Next Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements
1. **Configuration File**: Move regex patterns and settings to external config
2. **Multiple PDF Support**: Add batch processing capabilities
3. **Output Formats**: Add CSV/JSON export options
4. **Validation Rules**: Add data validation for extracted amounts and dates

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. **Expense Categorization**: Auto-categorize expenses based on description patterns
2. **Data Aggregation**: Monthly/yearly summaries and analytics
3. **Multiple Card Issuers**: Support for different PDF formats
4. **GUI Interface**: Web or desktop interface for easier use

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
1. **Database Integration**: Store and track expenses over time
2. **API Development**: RESTful API for integration with other systems
3. **Machine Learning**: Improve categorization and anomaly detection
4. **Multi-currency Support**: Handle different currency formats

## 🔧 Technical Settings & Configuration

### Dependencies
```
pdfplumber==0.10.3
tabulate==0.9.0
```

### Key Configuration Points
- **PDF Path**: Line 207 in `pdf_expense_extractor.py`
- **Regex Patterns**: Lines 89-91 for date, description, amount extraction
- **Table Format**: Line 149 for tabulate grid style
