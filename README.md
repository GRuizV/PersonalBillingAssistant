# Personal Billing Assistant (PBA)

The **Personal Billing Assistant (PBA)** is a CLI-based system that extracts, structures, and analyzes credit card bills from PDFs. The goal is to simplify personal financial tracking with no need for frontends or spreadsheets, and eventually enable natural language queries via WhatsApp using an LLM.



## 🚀 Project Purpose

Most people don’t track their expenses because the friction is too high — scattered PDFs, clunky UIs, no long-term summaries. PBA automates this by:

- Extracting expense tables from PDF bills
- Structuring and storing the data
- Generating monthly reports
- (Planned) Notifying users via WhatsApp
- (Planned) Answering questions like _"How much did I spend on food last month?"_ via LLMs


## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

    (Notifications / LLM Query Layer)


## 🧱 Current Development Status

We are currently working on:

### ✅ Phase 0: Groundwork
- Project structured into modular folders
- Textract selected as the parsing engine
- `.env` and secrets management scaffolded

### 🧩 Phase 1: Core Pipeline (WIP)
- Upload PDF to S3 [`upload_to_s3.py`] ✅
- Trigger Textract on uploaded files [`trigger_textract.py`] ✅
- Parse JSON output to extract expense tables 🔜
- Transform and clean expense records
- Store in PostgreSQL
- Run orchestrator script end-to-end
- Validate against ground truth for 3 known PDFs



## 🧠 LLM Integration (Planned)

Later phases will add:
- LLM-based natural query resolution
- Answering user questions via WhatsApp
- MCP-based access to stored structured data

LLMs will handle:
- Summarization
- Classification
- Contextual queries
- Financial insight generation

## ✍️ Contributions & Philosophy
This repo is designed to support both human engineers and LLM agents in parallel:

Modular + testable

Ground truth–driven validation

Ready for LLM-based automation
