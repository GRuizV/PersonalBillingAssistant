# Session Handover – 2025-07-23

## Last Achieved
- Completed **Textract integration**:
  - Implemented asynchronous Textract trigger with pagination → full table extraction.
  - Validated Textract output matches AWS Console output.
- Built **table parser**:
  - Extracted tabular data from Textract JSON into list-of-lists format.
- Designed and implemented **adapter-based expense transformer**:
  - Uses `bill_templates.json` for issuer-specific logic.
  - Handles currency separation (USD vs COP) automatically.
  - Filters payment rows (`ABONO SUCURSAL VIRTUAL`) while keeping other adjustments (negative values).
  - Preserves installments (`Cuotas`) as strings.
- Added **testing & validation**:
  - Created test for `extract_expenses.py`.
  - Built validation script with **precision & recall** metrics to compare output vs ground truth.

---

## Current Open Issues
- **Validation fine-tuning**:
  - Need to check transformer output vs ground truth for field-by-field correctness.
  - Ensure all negative values and adjustments are parsed correctly.
- **Template accuracy**:
  - Confirm if all relevant fields (`Número de Autorización`, `Fecha de Transacción`, `Descripción`, `Cargos y Abonos`, `Saldo a Diferir`, `Cuotas`) are consistently extracted.
- **Precision & recall optimization**:
  - Address minor mismatches (e.g., text normalization differences like `UBER RIDE` vs `UBER RIDES`).
- **Installments format**:
  - Validate if leaving `Cuotas` as string is final or if a derived pending count is needed.

---

## Next Steps
1. Run the validation script against **full ground truth** and analyze mismatches.
2. Adjust parsing logic for:
   - Description normalization (minor spelling or spacing differences).
   - Currency detection robustness.
3. Confirm overall precision & recall targets (e.g., ≥98%).
4. Document final field I/O contracts for transformer output.
5. Discuss potential database schema mapping for normalized expense records.

## Pending Decisions
- Should `Cuotas` remain raw strings permanently, or include derived pending count?
- Should issuer templates remain **unified under one file** or **split per issuer**?
- Should we add data contract documentation as part of context handover (to fully specify I/O formats)?
